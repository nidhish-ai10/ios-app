# Synchronized Text-to-Speech Implementation

## Overview
This repository contains a complete iOS voice conversation app with synchronized text streaming and TTS functionality.

## Key Features

### üéØ Synchronized Text & Voice Output
- Text streams word-by-word as AI speaks
- Perfect timing synchronization between visual and audio
- Works with both OpenAI TTS and iOS Speech Synthesis fallback

### üéØ Enhanced Conversation Flow
- Real-time transcription with iOS Speech Recognition
- LLM processing with OpenAI GPT
- Synchronized response delivery (text + voice)

### üéØ Technical Implementation
- **ConversationMessage**: Modified to support mutable content for streaming
- **Text Streaming**: Word-by-word display with calculated timing
- **Parallel Processing**: TTS and text streaming run simultaneously
- **Error Handling**: Automatic fallback to iOS Speech Synthesis

## Projects Included

### 1. SayItDone (Main Project)
- Complete task management app with Firebase authentication
- Voice input for task creation
- User authentication and data persistence

### 2. TEST (Synchronized TTS Demo)
- Focused implementation of synchronized text streaming with TTS
- Real-time voice conversation with AI
- Clean, modern SwiftUI interface

## Security Configuration

### API Key Setup
‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Replace the placeholder API key in `TEST/ContentView.swift` line 206:

```swift
let apiKey = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE"
```

With your actual OpenAI API key.

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Open either `SayItDone.xcodeproj` or `TEST.xcodeproj` in Xcode
3. For TEST project: Replace `YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE` with your OpenAI API key
4. Build and run the project

## Test Results
‚úÖ Build successful with no warnings or errors
‚úÖ Synchronized text streaming implemented
‚úÖ TTS integration working with fallback
‚úÖ Real-time conversation flow functional
‚úÖ Security: API key sanitized for repository
